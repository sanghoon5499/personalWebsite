# Personal Website - Sanghoon Choi

This is my personal website!\n

Made this with Three.js, a new framework for me.\n
It allows for 3D geometry to be loaded directly in the web browser; super cool!\n
Check out a lot of other (and more amazing), projects here: https://threejs.org/

Most features in place, but Work Experience and background geometry.

## Usage in localhost:

```
npm init vite
>vanilla js
npm install three
npm run dev
```
